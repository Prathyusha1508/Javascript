        <summary>Variables</summary>
        <p>Variable is a container(storage space) to hold data.
        </p>
        <p>Variables will have scope in javascript which refers to the region of code where a variable can be accessed.There are two main types of scope in javascript:</p>
        <li>Global variables:</li>
        <p>Global variables are declared outside of any function, and can be accessed from anywhere in the program.</p>
        <li>Local variables:</li>
        <p>Local variables are declared inside of a function, and can only be accessed from within that function.</p>
        <p>In JavaScript, users can declare a variable using 3 keywords that are var, let, and const.</p>
        <li>Var keyword:</li>
        <p>The scope of the var keyword is the global or function scope. It means variables defined outside the function can be accessed globally, and variables defined inside a particular function can be accessed within the function.</p>
        <li>let keyword:</li>
        <p>The let keyword is an improved version of the var keyword.The scope of a let variable is only block scoped(local). It canâ€™t be accessible outside the particular block.</p>
        <li>const keyword:</li>
        <p> The const keyword has all the properties that are the same as the let keyword, except the user cannot update it.The scope of a const keyword is block-scoped(local)</p>
       <p>when users declare a const variable, they need to initialize it, otherwise, it returns an error. The user cannot update the const variable once it is declared. </p>
        <p>There are some rules while declaring a JavaScript variable (also known as identifiers);</p>
        <li>Name must start with a letter (a to z or A to Z), underscore( _ ), or dollar( $ ) sign.</li>
         <li>After first letter we can use digits (0 to 9), for example value1.</li>
           <li>JavaScript variables are case sensitive, for example x and X are different variables.</li>
           <li>keywords cannot be used as variable names.</li><br>

            <summary>Datatypes</summary>
            <p>JavaScript provides different data types to hold different types of values.JavaScript is a dynamic type language, means you don't need to specify type of the variable because it is dynamically used by JavaScript engine.  There are two types of data types in JavaScript.</p>
            <li>Primitive datatypes:</li>
            <p>Primitive datatypes are a set of basic datatypes and they are pre-defined. These are immutable which means the value cannot be changed once created.There are 5 datatypes in javascript;</p>
            <p>String:Represents sequence of characters</p>
            <p>Number:Represents numerical values</p>
            <p>boolean:Represents boolean value either true or false.</p>
            <p>undefined:Represents undefined value which means the variable is declared but no value assigned to it.</p>
            <p>Null:Represents null or no value at all.Here value is assigned but null value i.e 0. The default null value in javascript is 0.</p>
            <li>Non-Primitive datatypes:</li>
            <p>Non-primitive datatypes are user-defined and are mutable which means the value can be changed once the value is created. There are 3 types of Non-primitive datatypes in javascript;</p>
            <p>Array:Array is a collection of heterogenous data which means we can store mutliple datatypes in an array.</p>
            <p>Object:It is an instance that allows us to access members in JavaScript.It is written as key-value pairs to store different type of data.</p>
            <p>RegEx:The RegExp object compares a string to a particular pattern. We can find if a regular expression pattern is present in the string or not using the comparison functions of the RegExp object.</p>
